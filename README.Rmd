# speedDate

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

speedDate makes it easy to get date format strings for use with `strftime()`.

## Installation

You can install the released version of speedDate from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("gadenbuie/speedDate")
```

## Example

Does formatting a timestamp into a character string always start with a long scroll through `?strftime` to look up the correct format tokens?
Now you can get those tokens faster and move on with your day.

The **speedDate** RStudio addin gives you a date

```
`r strftime(as.POSIXct(1136239445.987654, origin = "1970-01-01"), "%A %B %e, %H:%M:%OS6 %G %z", tz = "MST")`
```

and asks you to write it in text in the desired format. So you enter...

```
On 01.02.2006 at 15:04
```

...and the addin immediately gives you the format you want!

```
"`r speedDate:::guess_format("On 01.02.2006 at 15:04")`"
```
